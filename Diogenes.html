        <img src="images/Diogenes.png" alt="Diogenes" class="mx-auto d-block pb-5 img-fluid">
        <p class="fs-5 ">Imagine roaming the streets of Athens armed with a lantern, he wasn’t looking for a lost item
            or a way out of the labyrinthine alleys, not for the purpose of lighting the way, but for something much
            more elusive — an honest man. For Diogenes, a Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Cynicism,
            truthfulness was paramount, and his quest for an honest person became his life’s purpose. <br>
            In a world filled with falsehoods and pretenses, Diogenes stood firm in his belief that brutal honesty was
            the only way to live. He did not concern himself with the niceties of manners, instead choosing to live his
            life in a way that championed truth above all else. This even extended to his willingness to publicly shed
            his clothes, an act that was seen as shocking and controversial in his time. Diogenes was a contentious
            figure who allegedly faced banishment from Sinope for debasing currency. <br>
            A student of Antisthenes, who himself was a student of Socrates, Diogenes was known for his unorthodox
            approach to philosophy, which often bordered on madness. Plato even allegedly described him as “A Socrates
            gone mad.” However, Diogenes had a sense of humor that matched his eccentricity. When Plato famously defined
            man as a “featherless biped,” Diogenes showed up at his school with a plucked chicken and declared, “Here is
            Plato’s man.” <br>
            Diogenes was not one to shy away from challenging social conventions, engaging in public acts such as
            urination and masturbation. He did not see the need to apologise for his behaviour, when questioned about
            the latter, Diogenes humorously replied, “If only it was as easy to banish hunger by rubbing the belly as it
            is to masturbate.” <br>
            Legend has it that when Alexander the Great visited the renowned philosopher, Alexander asked Diogenes what
            he could do for him. According to Diogenes Laertius, Diogenes gave a curt reply, “Get out of my light,”
            however Valerius Maximus recounts a different version of the story, in which Diogenes asked Alexander to
            move out of the sun. Either way, Diogenes was clearly a man who knew what he wanted and wasn’t afraid to
            speak his mind. <br>
            It’s no wonder Alexander was impressed. He even went so far as to declare, “If I were not Alexander the
            Great, I would like to be Diogenes.” And who wouldn’t want to be? Diogenes was the epitome of cool, with a
            quick wit and a sharp tongue. He was the kind of guy who would have no problem telling you exactly what he
            thought about your outfit, your haircut, or your entire way of life. <br>
            But Diogenes was also a man who knew himself. When Alexander suggested that he would want to be Diogenes if
            he weren’t Alexander, the philosopher replied, “Were I not Diogenes, I also would want to be Diogenes.” And
            who could blame him? With his fearless attitude and unwavering sense of self, Diogenes was a force to be
            reckoned with. <br>
            He was not one to let insults slide. When a man once called him a dog, the philosopher retaliated by
            urinating on him. As recounted in the book “Herakleitos, Diogenes” by Guy Davenport, Diogenes later quipped,
            “Why was he so surprised?” The great cynic philosopher, was not one to mince words. In fact, he famously
            believed that philosophers who didn’t ruffle feathers were of little use. “Of what use is a philosopher who
            doesn’t hurt anybody’s feelings?” he once quipped. <br>
            When Diogenes saw a child of a prostitute throwing stones at a crowd, he didn’t hesitate to interject. With
            his trademark sharp wit, he shouted, “Take care that you don’t hit your father!” as recounted in Luis E.
            Navia’s book, Diogenes The Cynic: The War Against The World. <br>
            And when it came to the topic of marriage, Diogenes didn’t hold back his thoughts either. “Young men not
            ought to marry yet, and old men never ought to marry at all,” he once said. It’s clear that Diogenes wasn’t
            one for conventional ideas or sugar-coating his opinions. <br>
            The story of him being sold as a slave showcases his indomitable spirit and ability to make the most out of
            difficult situations. When his potential buyer seemed hesitant, Diogenes pointed to a man nearby,
            confidently declaring, “Sell me to this man; he needs a master.” The man followed through on the
            recommendation, entrusting Diogenes with his household and children. Even as a slave, he remained in control
            of his circumstances, making the most of his situation and continuing his pursuit of truth and honesty. <br>
            Bonus: A little introduction to Cynicism <br>
            In the world of cynicism, where individuals believe in the power of snarky comments and the truth that life
            is essentially a big joke. Cynics reject conventional wisdom and societal norms in favor of a more honest
            and realistic view of the world. They tend to view the world with a certain level of skepticism and are
            often critical of things that others may not question. <br>
            For instance, a cynic may question the motives of a politician, a corporation, or a charity. They might find
            the idea of happily ever after in a romantic movie to be unrealistic and instead focus on the practical
            challenges of a relationship. A cynic may also question the sincerity of a compliment or a gesture of
            kindness. <br>
            While cynics may not always be the life of the party, they often bring a unique perspective and humor to
            social situations. They may be the ones making sarcastic remarks about the decorations or cracking jokes
            about the absurdity of a situation. <br>
            So, if you’re interested in embracing your inner skeptic and challenging the status quo, cynicism might be
            the philosophy for you. Just be prepared for some eye-rolling from your more optimistic friends.
